Tutorials
========================================

Ipyannotator uses tutorials to demonstrate how the library can be used. 

All tutorials are statically generated from jupyter notebooks. 
All notebooks can be found on our `Github's repository <https://github.com/palaimon/ipyannotator/tree/main/nbs>`_

The notebooks contains the development dependencies: 
[pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/) and [ipytest](https://github.com/chmp/ipytest), 
if you want to run the notebooks remove the tests or install the libraries mentioned.
